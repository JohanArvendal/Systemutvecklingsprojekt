System Development Project from the Systems Science Program.
The project primarily consisted of four main components: business analysis, requirements analysis, software development, and project planning. Agile methodology was used based on SCRUM principles.

The goal of the project was to create a system that would support a fictional business in its operations and expansion. The business was a ski center offering a wide range of services such as:
apartments, camping, conference facilities, ski school, snowmobile rental, and ski equipment rental. The system was designed to support these services and provide staff with updated information about current bookings.

There are five different roles for logging into the system. Each role has its own permissions that determine which parts and functions of the system are accessible. The roles are:

- Marknadschef, Username and password: MC1
- Bokningspersonal, Username and password: BP1
- Skidshopspersonal, Username and password: SS3
- Ekonomipersonal, Username and password: EP4
- Systemadministrat√∂r, Username and password: SA5
